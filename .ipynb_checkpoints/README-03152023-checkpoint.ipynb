    "Regression techniques often face the challenge of dealing with correlated predictors, which can lead to unreliable model estimates. In biology, the variables are usually highly interconnected, and the relationships between them are complex and non-linear, making it difficult to obtain accurate regression models without incorporating prior knowledge. Traditional regression methods may not consider the potential impact of correlated predictors, including those representing Transcription Factors that regulate target genes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), for instance. Network-constrained regularization addresses this issue by imposing constraints on the regression coefficients based on a network structure, ensuring that the model is consistent with the underlying biology and reducing the risk of overfitting to noise. In recent years, several software packages, including GRegulNet, have been developed that implement network-constrained regularization approaches for biological applications. These methods enable the identification of complex and non-linear relationships between variables, which traditional regression methods may miss. GRegulNet incorporates information from a prior network to improve predictions and is particularly useful for analyzing biological data. By leveraging the underlying network structure, network-constrained regularization methods can help identify relationships, highlight important nodes and edges in the network, provide insight into the underlying biological processes, and improve model accuracy and biological/clinical significance of the models. GRegulNet can be applied to other biological and non-biological applications, and for various types of network-based learning tasks where predictors are correlated or interconnected. In summary, network-constrained regularization is essential in biological applications, as it enables the construction of more accurate and interpretable models that incorporate prior knowledge of the biological network structure. GRegulNet is a critical tool that allows for the incorporation of multiple types of network data, including protein-protein interaction networks, GRNs, and metabolic networks, leading to better understanding of complex biological systems. Overall, incorporating network-constrained regularization using tools such as GRegulNet is a critical step towards improving the accuracy and interpretability of regression models in biological and other applications."

    "## Demo (Toy Example) of GRegulNet:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have gene expression data for 5 Transcription Factors (TFs), [$TF_{1}$, $TF_{2}$, $TF_{3}$, $TF_{4}$, and $TF_{5}$] that are our respective predictors [$X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, $X_{3}$, $X_{4}$, and $X_{5}$]. We also have gene expression data for our target gene (TG), our response variable $y$.  We want to build a model to predict the expression of our $y$ based on the gene expression data of these 5 TFs. Our GRegulNet estimator will also incorporate a prior biological network of relationships among the TFs based on a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we build the GRegulNet estimator based on an **undirected prior graph network** of the relationships among our 5 Transcription Factors (TFs). As shown below, there is a particularly strong relationship between $TF_{1} \\leftrightarrow TF_{2}$ of 0.9 and between $TF_{4} \\leftrightarrow TF_{5}$ of 0.75. We specify the remaining relationships among the other TFs to be the default edge weight of 0.1.\n"

    "We can specify our $X$ and $y$ data to train our GRegulNet object using the *DemoDataBuilderXandY* class. In our demo, we utilize the *demo_dict* dictionary below to encode values for 3 parameters for our demo. Our class generates random data based on *num_samples_M* and *corrVals*. We specify *num_samples_M* is 100 samples. Further, we want the correlations of each of our predictors with the $y$ variable to be as provided by *corrVals*: [cor(TF$_{1}$, y) = 0.9, cor(TF$_{2}$, y) = 0.5, cor(TF$_{3}$, y) = 0.1, cor(TF$_{4}$, y) = -0.2, cor(TF$_{5}$, y) = -0.8]. Since *same_train_and_test_data_bool* is False, we will separate the data with 70% for training and 30% for testing.  There are additional parameters that we can adjust for our demo, but we wanted to retain simplicity. Please note that we explain more details about this class in *DemoDataBuilderXandY_explanation.ipynb*.\n",
